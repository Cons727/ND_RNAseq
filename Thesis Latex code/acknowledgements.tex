Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Ph.D. Juan Emmanuel Mart\'{i}nez Ledesma, for his enthusiasm, support and patience. I would like to express my gratitude to my family and friends who supported me during these years. It has been a difficult path that I could not have traverse without their encouragement to keep going. Moreover, I would like to show my gratitude to the Tecnol\'{o}gico de Monterrey for granting me the support on tuition with a merit scholarship, and CONACyT for the need-based scholarship.
